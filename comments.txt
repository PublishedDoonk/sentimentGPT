No issues so far!
Why do these clog so easily?
Meh, they're just ordinary drain pipes.
Five stars!
Leaked within a week.
Service was good, but the pipe wasn't.
Totally lost.
Expected better for the price paid.
Nothing special.
The pipes rusted! Are you kidding?
Thanks!
Could be cheaper for its quality.
Worst customer service ever experienced.
Arrived promptly, fit as expected.
The diameter was all wrong!
Good job.
Is this a joke? Terrible product.
Does the job.
Not worth the buy.
Would definitely recommend to others.
The color started fading? Seriously?
Installation was easy.
The pipes bent during transport!
Complete waste of money.
Satisfactory, but not the best.
Followed installation steps, still leaks!
Good value for the price.
Your pipes ruined my garden.
They work as drain pipes should.
My plumber laughed at your product.
Swift delivery and great performance.
Some good, some bad.
Garbage!
Happy with them so far.
Worst design ever! Who approved this?
Decent enough, but could be better.
So disappointed.
Met my expectations, I guess.
I've seen better quality in a toy store.
Great job!
Why so overpriced for junk?
Theyâ€™re functional, nothing more.
Will never buy from you again.
Holds up well against water pressure.
Thanks for nothing!
Not the worst, but close.
Impressed with the pipe's durability.
I regret buying from you.
Gets the job done.
You owe me a refund!
Happy customer.
So frustrating.
Not bad, but not great either.
I'd rather use cardboard tubes.
No complaints here.
Too thin and feels cheap.
Good product.
How do you even stay in business?
No issues.
Seriously? They're plastic, not gold!
Very satisfied.
Unbelievably shoddy craftsmanship.
Does what it says.
You call this premium quality?
Appreciate the prompt customer service.
Don't waste your money.
Thanks!
Such a rip-off.
Not too shabby for the price.
Is this a joke to you?
Kudos for the excellent material.
Never again.
No complaints.
I've seen better in dumpsters.
Good buy.
Terrible.
Good for regular usage.
Should've read reviews before buying.
Worth every penny.
You should be ashamed.
Happy with them.
Avoid!
Does its job.
I've been robbed of my money.
Good quality.
Feel scammed.
Meets the basic requirements.
You've lost a loyal customer.
Very pleased.
How did this pass quality checks?
Not the best, but it works.
I wouldn't even give this to enemies.
No issues to report.
Worst ever.
Satisfied customer.
I've made a huge mistake.
Functionality is decent.
You've been warned.
Fairly priced.
What a disgraceful excuse for a product.
